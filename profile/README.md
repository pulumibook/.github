## The Pulumi Book

Greetings, and welcome! :wave: 

Here you'll find repositories and other goodies that supplement [The Pulumi Book](https://pulumibook.com):

* The [**examples**](https://github.com/pulumibook/examples) repository contains all of the examples in the book, organized by chapter.
* The [**issues**](https://github.com/pulumibook/issues) repository tracks issues related to the content of the book &mdash; typos, syntax errors, glaring omissions, etc. 
* The [**Discussions**](https://github.com/orgs/pulumibook/discussions) tab hosts the book's discussion forum. Use it for asking questions and sharing what you think. I'd love to hear from you! And I'm sure other readers would as well.
* The [**Projects**](https://github.com/orgs/pulumibook/projects) tab tracks current and planned work for the book, along with progress on any issues filed on the examples or issues repositories.

Thanks for reading! :heart: In addition to starring or watching these repos, you can keep up with the book [on the website](https://pulumibook.com) and/or [following me personally on Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@cnunciato).
